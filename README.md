# English Classroom

Platforms such as [Preply][1] are great for English teachers and students to find each other and collaborate. It has very good tools for scheduling, instant messaging, showcasing/filtering teachers etc. However, tools such as assignment management, vocabulary builder, corrections etc are made generic so they can be useful to a large number of students and teachers. Such generic approaches fail to deliver the personal experience that is unique to each teacher. This project's goal is to create a suite of tools that suits the personal style of one particular teacher. This will deliver a more personal experience in a class compared to Preply for that teacher.

## Running the app locally

Running `docker-compose up` in the project root after cloning the project should bring the project up at http://localhost:3000. The local setup comes with one teacher account which you can use to play around; the username and password for this account are both `teacher`.
